      <h3>Dog Fowling</h3>
      The local council must keep public areas like parks, playgrounds and pavements clear of dog mess.
      Dog mess is the most unacceptable and offensive type of litter on our streets. Our research tells us that dog fouling is the issue the public are most concerned about.

      Dog fouling is not only deeply unpleasant, it is dangerous. Whilst rare, contact with dog excrement can cause toxocariasis â€“ a nasty infection that can lead to dizziness, nausea, asthma and even blindness or seizures.
